# TechCabal-Ew-Audio-Translation-Challenge-First-Place-Solution

**Overview**
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying basic directional commands in Ewe, a West African language. The goal is to improve navigation assistance for visually impaired individuals in linguistically diverse regions.
Model and Approach

Implemented a MatchboxNet model from scratch
Designed for audio classification tasks, specifically for recognizing spoken commands
Key features:

Deep learning approach using audio recordings
Language-specific training for Ewe
Custom architecture optimized for the task



**Dataset**

Audio files of directional commands in Ewe
Training Data: 200,000 samples
Test Data: 120,000 samples

**Project Pipeline**

Data Cleaning and Visualization

Audio loading and resampling
Silence removal
Bandpass filtering
Noise reduction
Spectral subtraction
Audio normalization


**Model Training and Building**

MatchboxNet architecture implementation
Training process with data loading, loss function definition, and optimization

**Future Work**

Explore additional audio classification models
Improve training data diversity
Integrate advanced linguistic features
Investigate transfer learning approaches
Develop a user-friendly interface or mobile application

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in addressing challenges faced by visually impaired individuals, particularly in linguistically diverse regions.
